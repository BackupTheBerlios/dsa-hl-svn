OgreNewt 4 Linux README
-------------------------

Ok, this is a really dirty release of OgreNewt for Linux and it may have, and 
almost for sure has bugs. Altough I haven't touched any internal code (Walaber 
did some really good work coding OgreNewt), I may have mistyped something or 
done something really really bad ;) So it's not a stable release, I guess Walaber 
will give us something more stable someday.
This is only library, no samples or whatever. They shouldn't be really hard to
build but I didn't need them. Feel free to add scons or makefile scripts.

List of changes
-----------------
- there's an #if in OgreNewt_World.h which defines OGRENEWT_CDECL. For Windows
  in every callback there had to be a _cdecl statement and Linux doesn't need 
  that kind of trick. So when OGRE_PLATFORM == OGRE_PLATFORM_WIN32 then 
  OGRENEWT_CDECL is _cdecl and in all other cases (I suppose Mac version
  doesn't need _cdecl too) then we have nothing in OGRENEWT_CDECL
  
- Linux is case-sensitive so I changed OgreNewt_Raycast.h to OgreNewt_RayCast.h
- in OgreNewt_CollisionPrimitives.cpp changed
  Ogre::HardwareIndexBuffer::IndexType::IT_32BIT to:
  Ogre::HardwareIndexBuffer::IT_32BIT
  as this is how it should look (I guess :)
- added newlines at the end of each file, gcc likes them :)
  
I suppose it's all. I'm not sure though.. there may be some other stuff 
I forgot about.

Installation
--------------
Oh, this is really dirty. I made a scons (http://www.scons.org) script, which 
builds OgreNewt as static library. I can't write makefiles and it's my first 
scons project, so it's an ugly hack. There's no checking for OGRE, you have to 
install it properly so pkg-config sees it.
About Newton - I just copied libNewton.a to /usr/lib and Newton.h to 
/usr/include and it works this way. If you don't know where's Newton for Linux, 
then here you are: http://newtondynamics.com/downloads/NewtonLinux.zip

So, if you have scons installed (Gentoo users: "emerge scons" is enough, 
I don't know about other distros) and Newton header and lib copied into 
mentioned directories then you just do execute "scons" in the directory 
where this file (and also SConstruct file) is. Wait a second or two and you 
have your libOgreNewt.a in src dir.
SCons is easy to use and read so feel free to modify it in a way that suits
your needs. Main build file is src/SConscript and that's where used CFLAGS 
are defined.

If you have any questions you can mail me at myak@tleilax.if.pw.edu.pl. You 
can also catch me via jabber: myak@chrome.pl.

Excuse my poor English, I hope you can understand what this document says :)
My Polish is far better (but who cares? :)

Oh, and don't mail me about OgreNewt as I don't really know it that well. 
Its author is Walaber (http://www.walaber.com) and he's the man to ask about it.

Ok, have fun!
