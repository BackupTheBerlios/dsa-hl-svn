 This script adds necessary import statements for switch Ogre 1.4 -> Ogre 1.6
 Only run it once on any given set of materials.
 If a base material's source file can't be determined,
 it is imported from __unkown_material_file__,
 so it is easy to spot missing files.

 This script expects a single base directory as argument,
 if none given process current directory
 call:
 > ruby material_upgrader.rb [base_directory]
